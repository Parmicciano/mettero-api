<h3> Why do this repository is public and notn private ?</h3>
<p> 
 
 There are a few reasons :
  - Making this public has forced me to secure my code, make it with no direct access to the sql database. 
  - It was fun to do because now everyone can found emails with their cpu power such as the bitcoin miners which are using cpu power to secure transaction on the blockchain.
